##
##Bessie is traveling on a road teeming with interesting landmarks.
##The road is labeled just like a number line, and Bessie starts at the "origin" (x = 0).
##A total of N (1 <= N <= 50,000) landmarks are
##located at points x_1, x_2, ..., x_N (-100,000 <= x_i <= 100,000).
##Bessie wants to visit as many landmarks as possible before sundown,
##which occurs in T (1 <= T <= 1,000,000,000) minutes. She travels 1
##distance unit in 1 minute.
##Bessie will visit the landmarks in a particular order.
##Since the landmarks closer to the origin are more important to Farmer John,
##she always heads for the unvisited landmark closest to the origin.
##No two landmarks will be the same distance away from the origin.
##Help Bessie determine the maximum number of landmarks she can visit
##before the day ends.
##INPUT FORMAT:
##* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: T and N
##* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer that is the
##location of the ith landmark: x_i
##SAMPLE INPUT:
